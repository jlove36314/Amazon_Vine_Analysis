## Summary

In Summation the is no evidence that supports there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in my dataset.  In fact, it appears the opposite has occurred. Members who are unpaid are 11.6% more likely to giva a 5-star rating.  This could be that perhaps the paid members are not as easily impressed.
